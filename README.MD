# Workout Routines

Goal is to build a Progressive web application that will allow user to create lifting routine. Reduce the complication of trying to figure out what to do next in their workout. Which would allow them to get in lift and get out. Have a visual progression of how much they have lifted of each exercise.
Functional Description

## Application Background

There was a time that I was lifting weights, getting stronger, and staying healthy. I know that it is important and I know sitting at a desk for 8 plus hours will not help the longevity of my life. Needless to say, the plan got pushed to the side and the business of life and other family events and a weightless life I would live.

Years later, I notice that have had more back injuries and energy. Even now as I sit here typing my back and hips have been in pain for a week and have crippled me. The desire to start getting stronger and healthier is at the forefront of my mind. 

Not only do I wish to have a healthier lifestyle but to build a web application. I am a React Developer, I like to build things using web technologies. So I could just download an app, but what kind of developer would I be without trying my hand at it. Below are what I hope to achieve with building this application. 

## Project Goals

- Build in public. share what I have learn and document the progress
