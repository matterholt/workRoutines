# Overview

    Create a simple new web application that will allow users to create and save their own personal lifting routine. The application would track users progress through their routine. Like weights, reps, sets and pass/fail the exercise. 
    
    
    
     Should be easy to get in there and complete the workout, 
    After a routine has been established, user would be able to activate the desired workout routine for that particular day. Once activated would be able to walk through the routine without a lot of interaction with web application. The only interaction should be add or remove weight, completed, failed, rest. The data that is display would have reps, sets, and plate count. After a routine has been completed, the date, weights, reps, sets of the workout will be saved. The routine for that day would also need to have weather the routine was able to complete or failed. 
    
    
     This will allow the user track their progression with routine.
